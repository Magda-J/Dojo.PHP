## Running Tests

To run these tests, you will need to install PHPUnit. You can do this by running `composer install` from the root of the project.

Once PHPUnit is installed, you can run the tests by running the following command from the root of the project:

```bash
    ./vendor/bin/phpunit ./tests
```
